# # 2. Increase history size
# # In bash, Setting the HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE variables to an empty string makes the bash history size unlimited. However, it's not possible to set the history to an unlimited size in zsh(theoretically, at least). From an zsh mailing list, it appears the max history size can be LONG_MAX from limits.h header file. That has a (really huge) value of 9223372036854775807, which should be enough to store trillions of commands (a limit we'll probably never hit). This number can be hard to remember - We can just set this to a billion, and forget it.
