# Quick Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, and save a comprehensive specification document to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work. Follow the `Instructions` and work through the `Workflow` to create the plan.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `specs/`

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: If no `USER_PROMPT` is provided, stop and ask the user to provide it.
- Carefully analyze the user's requirements provided in the USER_PROMPT variable
- Determine the task type (chore|feature|refactor|fix|enhancement) and complexity (simple|medium|complex)
- Think deeply (ultrathink) about the best approach to implement the requested functionality or solve the problem
- Understand the codebase directly without subagents to understand existing patterns and architecture
- Follow the Plan Format below to create a comprehensive implementation plan
- Include all required sections and conditional sections based on task type and complexity
- Generate a descriptive, kebab-case filename based on the main topic of the plan
- Save the complete implementation plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<descriptive-name>.md`
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer could follow it to implement the solution
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate to clarify complex concepts
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns

## Workflow

1. Analyze Requirements - THINK HARD and parse the USER_PROMPT to understand the core problem and desired outcome
2. Understand Codebase - Without subagents, directly understand existing patterns, architecture, and relevant files
3. Design Solution - Develop technical approach including architecture decisions and implementation strategy
4. Document Plan - Structure a comprehensive markdown document with problem statement, implementation steps, and testing approach
5. Generate Filename - Create a descriptive kebab-case filename based on the plan's main topic
6. Save & Report - Follow the `Report` section to write the plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md` and provide a summary of key components

## Plan Format

Follow this format when creating implementation plans:

```md
# Plan: <task name>

## Task Description
<describe the task in detail based on the prompt>

## Objective
<clearly state what will be accomplished when this plan is complete>

<if task_type is feature or complexity is medium/complex, include these sections:>
## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this task addresses>

## Solution Approach
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it addresses the objective>
</if>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the task:

<list files relevant to the task with bullet points explaining why. Include new files to be created under an h3 'New Files' section if needed>

<if complexity is medium/complex, include this section:>
## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe any foundational work needed>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work>

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish
<describe integration, testing, and final touches>
</if>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers with bullet points. Start with foundational changes then move to specific changes. Last step should validate the work>

### 1. <First Task Name>
- <specific action>
- <specific action>

### 2. <Second Task Name>
- <specific action>
- <specific action>

<continue with additional tasks as needed>

<if task_type is feature or complexity is medium/complex, include this section:>
## Testing Strategy
<describe testing approach, including unit tests and edge cases as applicable>
</if>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

<list specific commands to validate the work. Be precise about what to run>
- Example: `uv run python -m py_compile apps/*.py` - Test to ensure the code compiles

## Notes
<optional additional context, considerations, or dependencies. If new libraries are needed, specify using `uv add`>
```

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
✅ Implementation Plan Created

File: PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>
```
