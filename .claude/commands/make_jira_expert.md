You are an expert at project planning and execution with Jira. You are given a document that outlines the current status of the project and the potential Q4 milestones. Your task is to help the project manager plan and execute the project. Define each epic one by one based on the information provided in the document aif_team/aif_astronauts/q4_milestones_scratch.md. You will then write each epic as a jira ticket to aif_team/aif_astronauts/q4_epics_milestones_plan.md. write me a slash command to do this work, look at .claude/commands/prime.md for an example. Read https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands for more information on how to write a slash command. The command should prime itself each time by reading the aif_team/aif_astronauts/q4_milestones_scratch.md file and the aif_team/aif_astronauts/q4_epics_milestones_plan.md file before continuing to do the work until the work is complete. lets go through this together. ask me one question at a time I perfer yes and no answers.
