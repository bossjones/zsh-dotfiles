# pyright and BasedPyright Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for using pyright and BasedPyright in Python projects. These practices cover code organization, design patterns, performance optimization, security considerations, testing strategies, common pitfalls, and recommended tooling.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1 Directory Structure Best Practices

*   **Flat vs. Nested:** Choose a directory structure that balances simplicity and maintainability. For small projects, a flat structure might suffice. For larger projects, a nested structure that mirrors the module hierarchy is often better. For example:


    my_project/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── my_module/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── file1.py
    │   │   ├── file2.py
    │   ├── main.py
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── my_module/
    │   │   ├── test_file1.py
    │   │   ├── test_file2.py
    │   ├── conftest.py
    ├── pyrightconfig.json
    ├── pyproject.toml (or setup.py/setup.cfg)
    ├── README.md


*   **`src` Layout:** Use the `src` layout to separate application code from project metadata. This helps prevent accidental imports of test or configuration files.

### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

*   **Python Naming:** Follow standard Python naming conventions (PEP 8):
    *   Modules: `lowercase_with_underscores.py`
    *   Classes: `PascalCase`
    *   Functions and variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    *   Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
*   **Test Files:**  Name test files consistently, e.g., `test_<module_name>.py` or `<module_name>_test.py`.

### 1.3 Module Organization

*   **Cohesion:** Group related functions and classes within a single module.
*   **Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between modules to improve maintainability.
*   **`__init__.py`:** Use `__init__.py` files to define packages and control namespace imports.  Consider explicit relative imports within packages (e.g., `from . import module` instead of `import module`).

### 1.4 Component Architecture

*   **Layered Architecture:** For complex applications, consider a layered architecture (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).  This promotes separation of concerns and testability.
*   **Microservices:** For very large projects, consider breaking the application into microservices.

### 1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

*   **By Feature:** Split code into modules or packages based on features or functionality (e.g., `auth`, `users`, `products`).
*   **By Layer:**  Split code based on architectural layers (e.g., data access, business logic, presentation). This aligns with Layered architecture.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Defer loading modules or components until they are needed. This can improve startup time and reduce memory usage. Use the `importlib` module or dynamic imports for lazy loading.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1 Design Patterns

*   **Factory Pattern:** Use factory functions or classes to create objects, especially when the object creation logic is complex or needs to be configurable.
*   **Strategy Pattern:**  Use the strategy pattern to encapsulate different algorithms or behaviors and switch between them at runtime.  This promotes flexibility and testability.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Implement the observer pattern for event handling and decoupling components.
*   **Singleton Pattern:** Use sparingly and only when a single instance of a class is truly required. Consider dependency injection as an alternative.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches

*   **Type Annotations:**  Embrace type annotations throughout your codebase. This is essential for effective static analysis with pyright and improves code readability and maintainability.
*   **Configuration:** Externalize configuration data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) using environment variables or configuration files.  Use libraries like `python-dotenv` or `dynaconf`.
*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging using the `logging` module.  Configure logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) appropriately.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability. Libraries like `injector` can simplify dependency injection.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **Ignoring Pyright Errors:**  Treat pyright errors as critical issues that need to be addressed.  Do not silence errors without understanding the underlying problem.
*   **Overuse of `Any`:**  Avoid using `Any` excessively. It defeats the purpose of static typing.  Strive to provide specific type annotations.
*   **Magic Numbers:**  Avoid hardcoding numerical values or strings directly in your code. Use named constants instead.
*   **Global State:**  Minimize the use of global variables. Global state can make code harder to understand and test.
*   **Deeply Nested Code:**  Avoid deeply nested conditional statements or loops.  Refactor complex code into smaller, more manageable functions.

### 2.4 State Management

*   **Immutability:**  Favor immutable data structures where possible. This can simplify reasoning about state and prevent unintended side effects.  Use libraries like `attrs` or `dataclasses` to create immutable classes.
*   **Centralized State:** For complex applications, consider using a centralized state management solution (e.g., using Redux-like patterns or libraries).

### 2.5 Error Handling

*   **Exceptions:** Use exceptions for exceptional situations.  Raise specific exception types that accurately describe the error.
*   **`try...except`:** Use `try...except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.  Avoid catching generic `Exception` unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Logging Errors:** Log exceptions with sufficient context (e.g., traceback, relevant variable values). This is crucial for debugging.
*   **Resource Management:** Use `try...finally` or the `with` statement to ensure resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs.
*   **Retry logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for network requests or other operations that may transiently fail. Use libraries like `tenacity`.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1 Optimization Techniques

*   **Profiling:** Use profiling tools (e.g., `cProfile`) to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
*   **Efficient Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures for your tasks. For example, use sets for membership testing, and dictionaries for fast lookups.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Optimize algorithms to reduce time complexity. Consider using libraries like NumPy for numerical computations.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching to store frequently accessed data and avoid redundant computations. Use libraries like `functools.lru_cache` or `cachetools`.
*   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Explore using JIT compilers like Numba to accelerate numerical code.

### 3.2 Memory Management

*   **Generators:** Use generators to process large datasets without loading them into memory all at once.
*   **Context Managers:** Use context managers (`with` statement) to ensure that resources are properly released, preventing memory leaks.
*   **Object Reuse:** Reuse objects where possible to reduce memory allocation overhead.
*   **Avoid Circular References:** Circular references can prevent garbage collection. Use weak references (`weakref` module) to break cycles when needed.

### 3.3 Bundle Size Optimization (Applicable for web applications using pyright in the backend)

*   **Code Minification:** Minify JavaScript and CSS code to reduce bundle size.
*   **Tree Shaking:** Use tree shaking to remove unused code from your bundles.
*   **Code Splitting:** Split your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images to reduce their file size.
*   **Compression:** Enable compression (e.g., gzip or Brotli) on your web server.

### 3.4 Lazy Loading

*   **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic imports (`import()`) to load modules or components on demand.
*   **Conditional Imports:** Conditionally import modules based on certain conditions.

## 4. Security Best Practices
