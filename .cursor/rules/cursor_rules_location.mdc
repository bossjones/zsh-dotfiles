    message: |
      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

      5. Format the globs section correctly:
         - Use unquoted glob patterns: `globs: *.py` ✓
         - Do NOT use quoted glob patterns: `globs: "*.py"` ✗
         - Multiple patterns should be comma-separated: `globs: *.py, *.md, *.txt`

      6. Configure rule application mode correctly:
         - Include the `alwaysApply` field in the frontmatter
         - Set appropriate values based on rule type:
           ```
           ---
           description: Your rule description
           globs: *.py, *.md
           alwaysApply: false
           ---
           ```

      7. Follow these requirements based on rule type:
         - **Always** mode:
           - Set `alwaysApply: true`
           - `globs` can be empty
           - `description` can be blank

         - **Auto Attached** mode:
           - Set `alwaysApply: false`
           - `globs` must contain valid patterns
           - `description` should be populated

         - **Agent Requested** mode:
           - No special frontmatter requirements
           - `description` must be populated for discoverability

         - **Manual** mode:
           - Rule must be manually included in the chat window
           - No special frontmatter requirements

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Bad: Quoted glob pattern
      globs: "*.py"

      # Good: Unquoted glob pattern
      globs: *.py
      globs: *.py, *.md
