      When crafting prompts for Anthropic models:

      1. Structure your prompts with XML tags for clarity:
         ```xml
         <system>
           Define the AI's role and core capabilities
         </system>

         <context>
           Provide relevant background information
         </context>

         <examples>
           <example>
             <input>User query example</input>
             <thinking>Step-by-step reasoning process</thinking>
             <output>Expected response</output>
           </example>
         </examples>

         <user_query>
           The actual user query
         </user_query>
         ```

      2. Incorporate chain of thought elements:
         ```xml
         <thinking>
           1. First, I'll analyze...
           2. Then, I'll consider...
           3. Based on that, I can conclude...
         </thinking>

         <reasoning>
           Here's my step-by-step approach:
           1. Initial assessment
           2. Key considerations
           3. Trade-offs evaluated
           4. Final decision
         </reasoning>
         ```

      3. Use specialized XML tags:
         - <context> - For background information
         - <thinking> - For internal reasoning steps
         - <reasoning> - For explicit logical chains
         - <quotes> - For direct quotations
         - <examples> - For few-shot learning examples
         - <output> - For final responses
         - <reflection> - For self-assessment
         - <plan> - For outlining approach

      4. Best Practices:
         a. Be explicit about reasoning steps
         b. Break down complex tasks
         c. Show work clearly
         d. Use consistent tag structure
         e. Maintain clear tag hierarchy

      5. Chain of Thought Guidelines:
         - Start with a clear problem understanding
         - Break down complex reasoning
         - Show intermediate steps
         - Explain key decisions
         - Validate conclusions

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: No structured reasoning
      What's 123 * 456?

      # Good: Structured chain of thought
      <task>Calculate 123 * 456</task>
      <thinking>
        1. Break into parts: 123 = 100 + 20 + 3
        2. Multiply each part by 456:
           - 100 * 456 = 45,600
           - 20 * 456 = 9,120
           - 3 * 456 = 1,368
        3. Sum the results:
           45,600 + 9,120 + 1,368 = 56,088
      </thinking>
      <output>123 * 456 = 56,088</output>
    output: "Properly structured chain of thought reasoning"

  - input: |
      # Bad: Direct answer without context
      The code has a bug in the loop.

      # Good: Contextual analysis with reasoning
      <context>
        Analyzing a for loop in Python that's showing unexpected behavior
      </context>
      <thinking>
        1. First, check loop conditions
        2. Examine variable scope
        3. Verify iteration logic
        4. Consider edge cases
      </thinking>
      <reasoning>
        The loop counter isn't being incremented properly because...
      </reasoning>
      <solution>
        Modify the increment statement to ensure proper iteration
      </solution>
    output: "Clear reasoning process with context"
